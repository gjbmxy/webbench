<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Webbench is a group of benchmarks that simulate web application. Currently it includes these benchmarks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blogbench</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's Blogbench</h2>
<p>Blogbench is a database benchmark to simulate database operations of real-done 
blog applications. Its main features are the authenticity of the simulation of 
the web application, easy to use and high flexibility. It can be used to test 
whether a database is suitable for web application. </p>
<h2>Why develop Blogbench</h2>
<p>The reason why develop Blogbench is that the frequently-used benchmarks 
available have such disadvantages: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>DBT2: DBT2 is a open source implementation 
of TPS-C, the feature of its application is more of update transactions, less of 
read transactions. This is different from blog application and lack of flexibility. 
It can't be used to only test some type of simple operation, and go against 
performance optimization. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Sysbench: sysbench has high flexibility. It includes 
9 types of operation. Each operation can be tested separately. This is very useful 
to performance optimization. But the disadvantages of sysbench are that it only 
uses a fixed length table and the operation is much different from web application 
like blog. Such as range query on primary key and sort after query according secondary 
key rarely occurred in web application. So the result of sysbench is not helpful to 
proving that database adapts to web application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Simulate real-done blog application. Table schema, feature of data in table, 
types of operation, and data distributions are designed according our statistic 
information of blog application.</p>
</li>
<li><p>High performance. The overhead of benchmark itself is much lower than server's 
overhead.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Flexible. Each type of operation can be tested separately in order to facilitate 
analyze and optimize performance bottlenecks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
